## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned on how to use downloaded fonts and practiced the HTML and CSS concepts that I have learned throughout my journey such as responsive design, flexbox, and semantic HTML5 markup.

### Continued development

I plan to use this as sort of an inspiration for my future projects.

### Useful resources

to achieve the design.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to identify the HTML tags I needed 
to achieve the design.
